TODO - more letter of introduction. add content aligning with target

I am a interdisciplinary, collaborative, maker-builder-developer-researcher. +

I work with people from all backgrounds to make, explore and understand meaningful experiences. I use a myriad of technologies to support this process, whilst keeping the human front and center. +

My excellent communication skills afford highly effective colloborative projects. +

My research walks between Computer Science and the Arts. My works have resulted in both academic papers and a large number of public performances and installations, both in the UK and internationally. +

I canâ€™t help but get down and get my hands dirty building in the real world - from art installations and physical computing devices; to custom leather work and just about anything that I can get away with. +

I am passionate about working with people and Open Source software/hardware. Broad, strong technical knowledge +

I have extremely strong, creative problem solving skills, excellent leadership and project management experience, and strong background in delivering effective, novel projects and events. +



I have a PhD (Newcastle, UK) and BEng (York, UK) in Computer Science.
