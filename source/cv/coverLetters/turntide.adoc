*Re: {job-title}*

Dear {job-company} hiring team,

I've seen your ad for a *Senior Embedded Software Engineer* and your more general *Opportunities within Engineering* ad and I am very keen to work with {job-company}. I have significant Software Engineering capabilities. Mostly I have worked in more pure-software roles, but I've spent some time in the electronics and embedded space, and I believe I would be able to contribute valuably to {job-company}. Most recently I have been contracting on some work relating to schematic and physical layout of electronic components for PCBs.

I would particularly like to work for a company focused on sustainability and {job-company} really meets that. I really like how {job-company} presents itself - particularly the focus on diversity and people as the most important asset. 

I bring with me technical excellence with a strong love of agile and TDD with 20 years of experience in many different domains. In addition to having deep technical capabilities, I am particularly focused on encouraging best practices in Software Engineering - DevOps approaches with attention to enabling, unblocking and coaching team members.

With a caring, human-first leadership approach, I'm experienced working with and managing cross-functional teams, including remote members, across all layers of the technology stack (fullstack). I'm also entirely comfortable working as part of a team in a flatter, peer-peer structure.

I'm confident working closely with client stakeholders and internal team members on all aspects from low-level details right up to strategic and architectural discussions and planning. I'm focused on effectively delivering better value sooner. I'm am experienced working on cloud services, but also on-prem and desktop platforms, as well as with custom sensors and electronics.

I would like to continue growing both technically and as a collaborator/leader, and love working with people to produce great work and happy teams. Working at {job-company} looks to be perfectly aligned with these goals. I would love to learn more in the embedded space and I'm confident that my mixture of skills on my human-led approaches can bring significant value to the {job-company}.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to discussing further at your convenience.

Kind regards,



John
