*Re: {job-title}*

Dear {job-company} hiring team,

I would like to apply for the role of {job-title}. I would particularly like to work for a company focused on sustainability and {job-company} really meets that. I really like how {job-company} presents itself - particularly the focus on diversity and people as the most important asset.

I am currently coming to the end of some contract and consulting work and looking to move back to a permanent role where I collaborate closely with people day to day. 

I bring with me technical excellence with a strong love of agile and TDD with 20 years of experience in many different domains. In addition to having deep technical capabilities, I am particularly focused on encouraging best practices in Software Engineering - DevOps approaches with attention to enabling, unblocking and coaching team members.

With a caring, human-first leadership approach, I'm experienced working with and managing cross-functional teams, including remote members, across all layers of the technology stack (fullstack). I'm also entirely comfortable working as part of a team in a flatter, peer-peer structure.

I'm confident working closely with client stakeholders and internal team members on all aspects from low-level details right up to strategic and architectural discussions and planning. I'm focused on effectively delivering better value sooner. I'm am experienced working on cloud services, but also on-prem and desktop platforms.

I would like to continue growing both technically and as a collaborator/leader, and love working with people to produce great work and happy teams. Working at {job-company} looks to be perfectly aligned with these goals. I have experience across your set of requirements and I'm confident that I can bring significant value to the company.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to discussing further at your convenience.

Kind regards,



John
