*Re: {cpp} Systems Programmer*

Dear Vicon,

I would like to apply for a role with yourselves. My most recent role has been as a Software Engineering Manager, in a very hands-on role, with a large amount of high-performance 3D geometry processing in {cpp}, and novel algorithm development. I've discussed your advertised role with my recruiter (Reqiva), who suggest that talking together about possible options may be the best course of action - I am open to all sort of roles with Vicon, including pure developer roles, as well as more leadership roles. Reqiva will also mention that my 2nd in-command from my previous role (Liam Adams) is also interested in Vicon (has already applied), and continuing to work with him would be bring you a very effective pairing who work well together.

I am technically capable across a wide set of technologies, though currently have a preference for {cpp}, 3D, Graphics, and high-performance computing (GPU etc). In addition to having deep technical capabilities I am particularly focused on encouraging best practices in Software Engineering - Agile, DevOps approaches with attention to enabling, unblocking and coaching team members.

With a caring, human-first leadership approach, I'm experienced working with and managing cross-functional teams, including remote members, across all layers of the technology stack (fullstack).

Coincidentally, I have some significant experience with using Vicon products from my PhD and research career, and this leads to a significant interest in working specifically with yourselves.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to discussing further at your convenience.

Kind Regards,



John
