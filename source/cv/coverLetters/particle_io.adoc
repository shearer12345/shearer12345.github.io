*Re: Engineering Manager (Europe)*

Dear Particle.io,

I would like to apply for the role of Engineering Manager (Europe) with yourselves.
I was particularly taken by your focus on enabling and unblocking diverse team members as well as particle.io's core values. I  would love to learn more about the role and particle.io.

I'm confident that I would be an excellent fit for this position, with my combination of  a caring,
human-first leadership style and deep technical capabilities. I'm experienced working with and managing cross-functional teams, including remote members, across all layers of the technology stack. See my attached CV for further details.

I would like to continue growing as a leader and love working with people to produce great work and happy teams - working at particle.io looks to be perfectly aligned with these goals and I'm sure that I can bring significant value to yourselves.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to discussing further at your convenience.

Kind Regards,



John
