*Re: Software Engineering Manager*

Dear {recruiter},

I'm an experienced Software Engineering Manager and I'm looking for a new position in the Oxford area.

I am technically capable across a wide set of technologies, though currently have a preference for C++, 3D, Graphics, and high-performance computing (GPU etc).
With a caring, human-first leadership approach, I'm experienced working with and managing cross-functional teams, including remote members, across all layers of the technology stack (fullstack).

In addition to having deep technical capabilities I am particularly focused on encouraging best practices in Software Engineering - Agile, DevOps approaches with attention to enabling, unblocking and coaching team members.

I would like to continue growing as a leader and love working with people to produce great work and happy teams.

See my attached CV for further details.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to discussing further at your convenience.

Kind Regards,



John
