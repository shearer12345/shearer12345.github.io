Hi,

I've heard great things about Opencast. I particularly like your human approach to the work - both in terms of user-centred design and of internal collaboration, mentoring and continuous learning.

I am currently coming to the end of some contract and consulting work and looking to move back to a permanent role where I work closely with people day to day. 

I bring with me technical excellence with a strong love of agile and TDD and 20 years of experience in many different domains.

My notice period could be negotiable - very happy to discuss that along with anything else.

Best wishes

John
