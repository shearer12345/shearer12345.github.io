// TODO update personal summary

****
I am an interdisciplinary, collaborative, maker-builder-developer-researcher. My work walks between Computer Science and the Arts, so I work with people from all backgrounds to make, explore and understand meaningful experiences. To do this I use a myriad of technologies to support this process, whilst keeping the end user front and centre.

I lead projects at all levels - from high-level strategic discussions and planning with involved parties, to getting my hands dirty and building art installations and physical computing devices in the real world - whatever the project needs. My works have resulted in both academic papers and a large number of public performances and installations, both in the UK and internationally.

My underpinning ethos is to collaborate with people in a research driven approach to build valuable products. In the brief portfolio that follows I will demonstrate that I use my range of strong problem solving skills, excellent leadership and project management experience to deliver effective, novel projects and events.
