* Research for Unilever PLC on Persuasive Virtual Agents to support health life styles - directly related to my (concurrent) PhD research.
  ** I explored through empirical studies how Persuasive Agents provide value in various contexts.
  ** During the project I developed Persuasive Agents using 3D Graphics, Computer Vision and AI techniques. I designed and ran studies with large numbers of participants to provide statistical evidence.
